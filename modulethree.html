        <P style="color: white;">What is Laser Cutting? <br> </P>
        <p> Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to vaporize materials, resulting in a cut edge. While
            typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, it is now used by schools, small businesses,
            architecture, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly
            through optics. The laser optics and CNC (computer numerical control) are used to direct the laser beam to
            the material. A commercial laser for cutting materials uses a motion control system to follow a CNC or
            G-code of the pattern to be cut onto the material.
            <br>

            Laser Cutting is a very meticulous process. It requires Laser Cutting Machine as well as a software to guide
            the machine. The one used in our lab is developed by Suresh Indu Lasers Pvt. Ltd. There are many software
            options available such as LightBurn, LaserCAD, CorelDRAW, Adobe Illustrator, etc. The software we are using
            in the lab is LASERCAD.

        <p style="color: white;"> Why LaserCAD? <br> </p>
        <p>LaserCAD is a leading software solution for laser cutting and engraving, often provided by manufacturers of
            laser cutting machines. It offers vector drawing tools for creating intricate designs, supports image
            processing for detailed engraving, and includes a material library for optimal cutting parameters. With a
            user-friendly interface and compatibility with specific laser cutting machines, LaserCAD streamlines the
            design and production process, making it a comprehensive tool for laser cutting applications.

            <p style="font-size: 30px;color:#0ce478;margin: 80px;text-align: center; margin-top: -20px;">All members
                were divided into groups of 4, for this module. For our first cut, we were told to use simple designs so
                as to familiarize with the machine functions and the software interface. We were given quite the liberty
                to chose our own designs and so we chose a Mandala Pattern as our first. We designed it in the Fusion
                360 software since we are now used to it and exported into .dxf file. This file was then imported into
                the LaserCAD software. After properly setting dimensions, we downloaded the file into the machine.
                Guided by our instructors, we successfully created our first ever laser cut. 2D laser cutting is a
                highly precise and efficient manufacturing process used across various industries for cutting flat sheet
                materials such as metal, plastic, wood, and composites. It involves the use of a high-powered laser beam
                to vaporize, melt, or burn away material along a predetermined path, guided by a computer-controlled
                system. The laser beam is focused through a lens to achieve a small spot size, resulting in intricate
                and accurate cuts with minimal heat-affected zones. This process offers several advantages, including
                high speed, repeatability, and the ability to cut complex shapes without the need for tool changes.
                Additionally, it can be easily automated, making it suitable for both prototyping and large-scale
                production. </p>

                agenda was Engraving an image on cardboard. We began the day with a comprehensive overview of the
                cardboard engraving process, discussing the types of images suitable for engraving and the optimal
                settings for achieving desired results. A detailed tutorial was provided on using the LaserCAD software,
                covering image import, setting parameters such as speed and power, and previewing the engraving process.
                Image engraving with laser cutting is like using a high-tech pen to draw pictures or patterns on
                materials like wood, metal, or plastic. Instead of ink, it uses a powerful laser beam to burn away tiny
                bits of the material, creating designs. You can control how deep the laser goes and how detailed the
                design is by adjusting settings. It's great for making custom signs, decorations, or adding logos to
                products because it's precise and can create really intricate designs. It's kind of like printing, but
                instead of ink, you're using a laser to make cool pictures on stuff!

                intricacies of laser cutting techniques, mastering the art of transforming raw cardboard sheets into
                intricate shapes and structures. The precision of the laser cutter allowed us to bring our designs to
                life with unparalleled accuracy, from simple prototypes to complex architectural models. We ended up
                choosing a simple model for our workshop, but it was still very satisfying seeing the model come to
                life. The model we chose was a simple biplane, the kind you would often see in video games. I was
                magnificent to see it out of the world of 2D images and become a 3D model for our project.

                is a highly precise and versatile manufacturing process that utilizes a focused laser beam to cut
                through various materials with exceptional accuracy. The process involves a computer-controlled system
                guiding the laser beam along the desired cutting path, which can range from simple geometric shapes to
                intricate designs. One of the key advantages of laser cutting is its ability to cut through a wide range
                of materials, including metals, plastics, wood, glass, and composites, with minimal heat-affected zones.
                This allows for clean and precise cuts without the need for additional finishing processes. Laser
                cutting is widely used across industries such as automotive, aerospace, electronics, and jewelry for
                applications such as part fabrication, prototyping, signage, and artistic creations.

                The versatility of laser cutting extends beyond simple cutting operations. It can also be used for
                engraving, marking, and etching designs onto the surface of materials. This makes laser cutting an ideal
                choice for adding logos, serial numbers, or decorative patterns to products and components.
                Additionally, laser cutting offers advantages in terms of speed and efficiency compared to traditional
                cutting methods. With advancements in laser technology, including the development of high-power fiber
                lasers and CO2 lasers, manufacturers can achieve even faster cutting speeds and higher precision.

                Moreover, laser cutting is a highly automated process, which allows for increased productivity and
                reduced labor costs. Computer numerical control (CNC) technology ensures repeatability and consistency
                in cutting operations, making it suitable for both small-scale production and large-scale manufacturing.
                Furthermore, laser cutting is environmentally friendly, as it produces minimal waste and does not
                require the use of harmful chemicals or solvents.

                In conclusion, laser cutting is a sophisticated manufacturing process that offers exceptional precision,
                versatility, and efficiency. Its ability to cut through various materials and create intricate designs
                makes it indispensable across a wide range of industries. With ongoing advancements in laser technology,
                laser cutting continues to evolve, providing manufacturers with innovative solutions for their cutting
                and engraving needs.
